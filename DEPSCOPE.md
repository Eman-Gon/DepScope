## Findings

### CRITICAL

- **Missing License** — The repository is listed with 'NONE' as the license. This creates a significant legal risk as there are no granted rights to use, modify, or distribute the software.
  - *Recommendation:* Do not install or use until an OSI-approved license is added to the repository.
- **Active CVE Associations** — Five CVEs (including CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2025-64328) are associated with this package. Given the package was only created in February 2026, this indicates immediate exploitation or severe architectural flaws.
  - *Recommendation:* Blacklist this package immediately; the ratio of vulnerabilities to project age is an extreme outlier.

### HIGH

- **Zero Maturity and No Releases** — The project was created and last updated on the same day (2026-02-06), has zero releases, and zero stars. It is effectively an experimental or 'alpha' script.
  - *Recommendation:* Wait for a stable release (v1.0.0) and at least 6 months of active maintenance before consideration.

### MEDIUM

- **Low Bus Factor** — A single contributor accounts for 62% of the activity in a project with only 3 contributors, leading to a 'warning' status for bus factor.
  - *Recommendation:* Ensure internal team members can maintain a fork if the primary maintainer abandons the project.

## Alternatives

| Package | Migration Difficulty | Why |
|---------|---------------------|-----|
| Socket.dev | easy | Provides mature, multi-layered security analysis for dependencies with a proven track record. |
| Snyk | easy | Industry standard for vulnerability scanning and dependency due diligence. |

---

## Verdict

> DepScope is a high-risk, unproven dependency that should be rejected for production use. The combination of a missing license, multiple immediate CVEs, and zero community validation suggests this may be a malicious package or a highly unstable research project. Use established alternatives like Snyk or Socket for dependency due diligence.
